# Ocular-disease-image-recognition
This is a practice for using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model for image recognition. The repository includes a brief inroduction of CNN model and the model application using keras. The programming language for this project is python.

## Data Source & Management Command
The data source for this project is from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k'>Kaggle - Ocular Disease Recognition</a>. The dataset contains 6,392 images of left and right eyes for approxiamte 3,500 patients collected by Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. The patients are classified into 8 groups, based on their specific ocular disease: Normal (N), Diabetes (D), Glaucoma (G), Glaucoma (G), Cataract (C), Age related Macular Degeneration (A), Hypertension (H), Pathological Myopia (M), Other diseases/abnormalities (O)

## Models and Approaches
1. Binary - Normal (N) to Other Diseases
2. Multi-categories
3. Categories exploration
  * Normal (N) to Diabetes (D)
